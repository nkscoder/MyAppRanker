						are registered in [trade register]; you can find the 
						online version of the register at [URL], and our 
						registration number is [number].<br><br>20.2 We are 
						subject to [authorisation scheme], which is supervised

						United Kingdom] and are subject to [rules], which can be

						<br>[additional list items]<br><br><br><br>Free website 
						terms and conditions: drafting notes<br>This is a free 
						version of our standard website terms and conditions 
						document. It is identical to that document, save that 
						this version includes an SEQ legal credit. In addition 
						to the provisions that would typically be included in 
						any set of website terms and conditions, this document 
						includes provisions covering user accounts and 
						user-generated content (although the latter are not as 
						detailed as in some of our more sophisticated website 
						terms and conditions documents). If your website does 
						not feature user accounts or interactive features, you 
						may wish to consider our website disclaimer document 
						instead of these terms and conditions.<br><br>Section 1: 
						Introduction<br>Section 1.2<br>Optional element.<br><br>
						The completed document should be easily accessible on 
						the website, with a link from every page.<br><br>Section 
						1.3<br>Optional element. Will all or any website users 
						give their express consent to the terms of this 
						document?<br><br>Ideally, from a legal perspective, all 
						users would be asked to expressly agree to the terms of 
						the document. However, in practice, express consent is 
						rarely sought from casual website visitors. On the other 
						hand, it is easy to obtain the express consent of users 
						who register with the website or submit any material to 
						the website, e.g. by clicking "I accept" on an 
						electronic version of the document. You should retain 
						evidence of the acceptance of the document terms by each 
						such user.<br><br>· Under what circumstances will users 
						be asked to give their express consent to the terms of 
						this document?<br><br>Section 1.4<br>Optional element. 
						Are there any age restrictions on the use of the 
						website?<br><br>The use of websites by minors can be 
						legally problematic. There are a number of different 
						legal issues. For example, under English law, contracts 
						may be unenforceable against minors. Another issue 
						concerns data protection. The law of data protection 
						imposes additional burdens in relation to the processing 
						of any personal data of a minor and personal data 
						provided by a minor. The effects of the law of indecency 
						may also depend upon whether a website is accessible by 
						minors. Obviously, the inclusion of a requirement in 
						your terms and conditions that minors refrain from using 
						a website is no guarantee that they will do so. Where 
						your website is directed at, or likely to be used by, 
						minors, we recommend that you seek specialist legal 
						advice.<br><br>· What is the minimum age for website 
						users?<br><br>Section 1.5<br>Optional element. Does the 
						website use cookies (including session cookies and third 
						party cookies)?<br><br>The inclusion of this statement 
						in your website legal documents will not in itself 
						satisfy the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic 
						Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (as 
						amended) concerning consent to the use of cookies. 
						Guidance concerning methods of obtaining such consent is 
						included on the Information Commissioner's website 
						(http://www.ico.gov.uk).<br><br>· What is the title of 
						the document on the website that contains cookie 
						information?<br><br>Section 2: Credit<br>Optional 
						element. Although you need to retain the SEQ Legal 
						credit, you should remove the inline copyright warning 
						from this document before use.<br><br>Section 3: 
						Copyright notice<br>Section 3.1<br>· What was the year 
						of first publication of the relevant copyright material 
						(or the range of years)?<br><br>· Who is the principal 
						owner of copyright in the website?<br><br>Section 4: 
						Licence to use website<br>The scope of the licence to 
						use will vary with each site. Consider carefully exactly

						<br>Section 11.2<br>Optional element.<br><br>Section 12: 
						Limitations and exclusions of liability<br>Contractual 
						limitations and exclusions of liability are regulated 
						and controlled by law, and the courts may rule that 
						particular limitations and exclusions of liability in 
						contracts are unenforceable. The courts are particularly 
						likely to intervene where a party is seeking to rely on 
						a limitation or exclusion of liability in its standard 
						terms and conditions, but will also sometimes intervene 
						where a term has been individually negotiated. The 
						courts may be more likely to rule that provisions 
						excluding liability, as opposed to those merely limiting 
						liability, are unenforceable. If there is a risk that 
						any particular limitation or exclusion of liability will 
						be found to be unenforceable by the courts, that 
						provision should be drafted as an independent term, and 
						be numbered separately from the other provisions. It may 
						improve the chances of a limitation or exclusion of 
						liability being found to be enforceable if the party 
						seeking to rely upon it specifically drew it to the 
						attention of the other party before the contract was 
						entered into. Exclusions and limitations of liability in 
						UK contracts are primarily regulated by the Unfair 
						Contract Terms Act 1977 ("UCTA"). Contracts regulated by 
						UCTA cannot exclude or restrict a party's liability for 
						death or personal injury resulting from negligence 
						(Section 2(1), UCTA). Except insofar as the relevant 
						term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness, such 
						contracts cannot exclude or restrict liability: (i) for 
						negligence (which includes a breach of an express or 
						implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care 
						or exercise reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or 
						(ii) for misrepresentation (Section 3, Misrepresentation 
						Act 1967). In addition, if a contract is regulated by 
						UCTA, and one of the parties is dealing on the other's 
						written standard terms of business, then except insofar 
						as the relevant contractual term satisfies the 
						requirements of reasonableness the other party cannot: 
						(i) exclude or restrict his liability in respect of a 
						breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be entitled to 
						render a contractual performance substantially different 
						from that which was reasonably expected of him; or (iii) 
						claim to be entitled, in respect of the whole or any 
						part of his contractual obligation, to render no 
						contractual performance at all (see Section 3, UCTA). 
						UCTA includes various other restrictions, particularly 
						in the case of contracts for the sale of goods and 
						contracts under which possession or ownership of goods 
						passes. If you wish to try to limit/exclude for 
						liability in respect of reckless, deliberate, personal 
						and/or repudiatory breaches of contract, you should 
						specify this in relation to the relevant provision (for 
						example, using the following wording: "The limitations 
						and exclusions of liability in this Clause [number] will 
						apply whether or not the liability in question arises 
						out of any reckless, deliberate, personal and/or 
						repudiatory conduct or breach of contract"). In many 
						circumstances, however, the courts will find these types 
						of limitations and exclusions to be unenforceable. 
						Somewhat different rules apply to limitations of 
						liability in contracts with consumers, and these 
						provisions should not be used in relation to such 
						contracts. These guidance notes provide a very 
						incomplete and basic overview of a complex subject. 
						Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may 
						wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of 
						liability.<br><br>Section 12.1<br>Do not delete this 
						provision (except upon legal advice). Without this 
						provision, the specific limitations and exclusions of 
						liability in the document are more likely to be 
						unenforceable.<br><br>Section 12.3<br>Optional element. 
						Do you want to attempt to exclude all liability for free 
						services and information?<br><br>This sort of exclusion 
						is quite common, but unlikely to be enforceable in 
						court.<br><br>Section 12.5<br>Optional element.<br><br>
						Section 12.6<br>Optional element.<br><br>Section 12.7<br>
						Optional element.<br><br>"Consequential loss" has a 
						special meaning in English law: it means any loss that, 
						whilst not arising naturally from the breach, was 
						specifically in the contemplation of the parties when 
						the contract was made.<br><br>Section 12.8<br>Optional 
						element. If the website operator is a limited liability 
						entity (e.g. a limited company), do you want to 
						expressly exclude liability on the part of officers and 
						employees?<br><br>Section 13: Breaches of these terms 
						and conditions<br>Section 13.1<br>· Will account 
						suspension or deletion be a possibility here?<br><br>
						Section 13.2<br>Optional element.<br><br>· Do you wish 
						to specify types of action that are prohibited here?<br>
						<br>· Detail the types of action which are prohibited by 
						this provision.<br><br>Section 14: Variation<br>Changes 
						to legal documents published on a website will not 
						generally be retrospectively effective, and variations 
						without notice to and/or consent from relevant users may 
						be ineffective.<br><br>Section 14.2<br>· Will website 
						users be notified of changes to the document?<br><br>
						Section 14.3<br>Optional element. Will registered users 
						be required to consent to variations?<br><br>Section 17: 
						Third party rights<br>Optional element.<br><br>This 
						provision is designed to exclude any rights a third 
						party may have under the Contracts (Rights of Third 
						Parties) Act 1999.<br><br>Section 18: Entire agreement<br>
						Section 18.1<br>· What other documents govern the use of 
						the website?<br><br>Section 19: Law and jurisdiction<br>
						The questions of which law governs a document and where 
						disputes relating to the document may be litigated are 
						two distinct questions.<br><br>Section 19.1<br>This 
						document has been drafted to comply with English law, 
						and the governing law provision should not be changed 
						without obtaining expert advice from a lawyer qualified 
						in the appropriate jurisdiction. In some circumstances 
						the courts will apply provisions of their local law, 
						such as local competition law or consumer protection 
						law, irrespective of a choice of law clause.<br><br>· 
						Which law should govern the document?<br><br>Section 
						19.2<br>In some circumstances your jurisdiction clause 
						may be overridden by the courts.<br><br>· Should the 
						jurisdiction granted be exclusive or non-exclusive? 
						Choose "non-exclusive" jurisdiction if you may want to 
						enforce the terms and conditions against users outside 
						England and Wales. Otherwise, choose "exclusive 
						jurisdiction".<br><br>· The courts of which country or 
						jurisdiction should adjudicate disputes under the 
						document?<br><br>Section 20: Statutory and regulatory 
						disclosures<br>Do the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) 
						Regulations 2002 apply to the website or is the website 
						operator registered for VAT?<br><br>This section can be 
						deleted where website operator is not registered for VAT 
						and the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 
						2002 do not apply. Generally, those Regulations will 
						apply unless a website is entirely non-commercial, i.e. 
						where a website does not offer any goods or services and 
						does not involve any remuneration (which includes 
						remuneration for carrying AdSense or other advertising).<br>
						<br>Section 20.1<br>Optional element. Is the website 
						operator registered in a trade or similar register that 
						is available to the public?<br><br>The Electronic 
						Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that if 
						you are "registered in a trade or similar register 
						available to the public", you must provide "details of 
						the register in which the service provider is entered 
						and his registration number, or equivalent means of 
						identification in that register".<br><br>· What is the 
						name of the trade register?<br><br>· At what URL can the 
						trade register be found?<br><br>· What is the website 
						operator's registration number?<br><br>Section 20.2<br>
						Optional element. Is the website operator subject to an 
						authorisation scheme (e.g. under financial services 
						legislation)?<br><br>The Electronic Commerce (EC 
						Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that "where the 
						provision of the service is subject to an authorisation 
						scheme" you must provide "the particulars of the 
						relevant supervisory authority".<br><br>· What is the 
						name of the authorisation scheme to which the website 
						operator is subject?<br><br>· What authority supervises 
						the authorisation scheme?<br><br>Section 20.3<br>
						Optional element. Is the service provider a member of a 
						regulated profession (e.g. solicitors)?<br><br>The 
						Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 
						provide that if "the service provider exercises a 
						regulated profession", it must provide "(i) the details 
						of any professional body or similar institution with 
						which the service provider is registered; (ii) his 
						professional title and the member State where that title 
						has been granted; (iii) a reference to the professional 
						rules applicable to the service provider in the member 
						State of establishment and the means to access them".<br>
						<br>· What is the website operator's professional title?<br>
						<br>· Which professional body regulates the website 
						operator?<br><br>· In which jurisdiction was the 
						professional title granted?<br><br>· What is the name of 
						the document containing the rules governing the 
						profession?<br><br>· At what URL can the rules be found?<br>
						<br>Section 20.4<br>Optional element. Does the website 
						operator subscribe to any codes of conduct?<br><br>The 
						Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 
						provide that "a service provider shall indicate which 
						relevant codes of conduct he subscribes to and give 
						information on how those codes can be consulted 
						electronically".<br><br>· Identify the codes of conduct 
						in question.<br><br>· Where can the codes be viewed?<br>
						<br>Section 20.5<br>Optional element. Is the website 
						operator registered for VAT?<br><br>· What is the 
						website operator's VAT number?<br><br>Section 21: Our 
						details<br>Optional element.<br><br>UK companies must 
						provide their corporate names, their registration 
						numbers, their place of registration and their 
						registered office address on their websites (although 
						not necessarily in this document). Sole traders and 
						partnerships that carry on a business in the UK under a 
						"business name" (i.e. a name which is not the name of 
						the trader/names of the partners or certain other 
						specified classes of name) must also make certain 
						website disclosures: (i) in the case of a sole trader, 
						the individual's name; (ii) in the case of a 
						partnership, the name of each member of the partnership; 
						and (iii) in either case, in relation to each person 
						named, an address in the UK at which service of any 
						document relating in any way to the business will be 
						effective. All websites covered by the Electronic 
						Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 must provide a 
						geographic address (not a PO Box number) and an email 
						address. All website operators covered by the Provision 
						of Services Regulations 2009 must also provide a 
						telephone number.<br><br>Section 21.1<br>· What is the 
						name of the company, partnership, individual or other 
						legal person or entity that owns and operates the 
						website?<br><br>Section 21.2<br>Optional element. Is the 
						relevant person a company?<br><br>· In what jurisdiction 
						is the company registered?<br><br>· What is the 
						company's registration number or equivalent?<br><br>· 
						Where is the company's registered address?<br><br>
